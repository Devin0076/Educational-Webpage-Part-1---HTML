            <h2>Habitat</h2>
            <p>Goblin Sharks are deep-sea dwellers, usually found at depths between 100 and 1,200 meters. 
  They prefer the dark, cold waters along continental slopes and submarine canyons where light barely reaches.</p>

            <p>They have been recorded in locations across the globe, including Japan, South Africa, Portugal, and the Gulf of Mexico. 
  Because of their remote habitat, encounters with humans are extremely rare.</p>

    <h3>Goblin Shark Overview</h3>
    <img src="images/goblinshark3.jpeg" alt="Close-up view of a goblin shark" class="center-img" width="300">
    <p>The Goblin Shark (<em>Mitsukurina owstoni</em>) is among the rarest sharks in existence. Belonging to an ancient family dating back over 100 million years, it is often called a “living fossil.”</p>
    <p>It is most famous for its long, flat snout and highly extendable jaws, which can shoot forward to capture prey with lightning speed. This unusual adaptation is unique among sharks.</p>
    <p>Goblin Sharks are pale pink in color due to blood vessels visible beneath their skin, giving them a ghostly appearance unlike any other shark.</p>

    <h3>Goblin Shark in the Wild</h3>
    <p>These sharks inhabit deep waters where sunlight cannot penetrate. They are most often found near the ocean floor, hunting in silence in the pitch-black environment.</p>
    <p>Their diet includes deep-sea fish, squid, and crustaceans. By thrusting their jaws forward, they can quickly snatch prey—perfect for the slow, dark conditions of their habitat.</p>
    <p>Although they appear menacing, Goblin Sharks pose no threat to humans and are rarely encountered. Their strange looks make them one of the most mysterious species of shark ever discovered.</p>
